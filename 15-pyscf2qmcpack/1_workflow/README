system: 2 carbon atoms in on a diamond lattice
basis: modified BFD double-zeta, diffuse functions removed by Lucas K. Wagner

diamond_carbon.py reads the checkpoint file 'vdz.h5' and makes the wavefunction file 'pyscf2pwscf.h5' and input file 'test.xml'. If the checkpoint file is not available, then pyscf will run the restricted Hartree-Fock calculation from scratch. The calculation is slow, but should not take more than 10 min on a 4-core Intel i5.

The test.xml file is not complete, so vmc.xml is provided as a reference.
